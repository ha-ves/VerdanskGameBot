# Verdansk Game Bot â€” A Game Server Watcher Discord Bot

This is a discord bot to watch your game server by utilizing [node-gamedig](https://github.com/gamedig/node-gamedig) and [Discord.NET](https://github.com/discord-net/Discord.Net/). It will report the game server status in a text channel. This bot is written in [.NET (dotnet)](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/) for cross-platform and __multi-threaded environment__ because it will watch many game servers. Game servers are stored in an SQLite database using [Entity Framework (EF) Core](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/ef/core/).
